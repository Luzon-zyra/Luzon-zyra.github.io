		The perfume’s aim is clear: to transform the famous Grasse rose, a symbol of voluptuousness and unqualified femininity, into an assertively virile fragrance that can be worn by anyone…
		<br>
		<br>
		The result is a model of its kind: alternating femininity and masculinity of the Centifolia rose, quickly picked up by a chorus of warm, spicy, and woodsy notes such as cumin, olibanum, cedar, and a touch of amber… In the background, the declared sensuality of Gaïac wood and cistus highlighted by distinctly musky notes, give this perfume a disconcerting sense of mystery.

		In the same way matcha tea is much more than just a drink in Japanese culture, THÉ MATCHA 26 is much more than a scent to us. It is a moment of introspection, a moment of self that offers a quiet inner celebration of grace and soulful beauty. A simple whiff takes us away from the hum of the outside and brings us back “in”.
		<br>
		<br>
		Matcha tea accord is infused with a creamy fig note, grounded by soft vetiver and textural cedar woods, and uplifted by enticing bitter orange.
		<br>
		<br>
		Introverted and deep by nature, THÉ MATCHA 26 is a skin scent, something meant for, and only those individuals lucky enough to be very close to, the wearer. It carries a noble stillness. To us, it is a scented reminder of home, of welcomed solitude, and of all things familiar and treasured.

		THÉ NOIR 29 is an ode to the noble leaf and the craft that surrounds it.
		<br>
		<br>
		THÉ NOIR 29 combines depth and freshness, softness and strength through permanent oscillation between the light of bergamot, fig, and bay leaves and the depth of cedarwood, vetiver, and musk. A special extraction of black tea leaves wraps up the composition by bringing to the formula a dry, leafy, hay, tobacco feeling in the dry down to transform this creation into a sensuous and addictive essence.

		YLANG 49 is a chypre floral, where pua noa noa (gardenia from Tahiti) completes the floral voluptuousness of ylang ylang…
		<br>
		<br>
		Patchouli, oakmoss, vetiver, sandalwood, and benjoin follow to tip the blend into darker sensual undertones... YLANG 49 is a walk in the woods, a lush floral bouquet in your hand, listening to J.S. Bach's well-tempered clavier and realizing that a floral composition can go beyond flowers, in the same way a fugue in D minor is way beyond the D.

		In 2010, Le Labo was commissioned by An0ther Magazine to work on an exclusive scent. This project was born thanks to Sarah of Colette who initiated the creative collaboration between Le Labo and Jefferson Hack, editor-in-chief of An0ther Magazine. The result of this collaboration is ANOTHER 13, a hypnotizing and unique scent.
		<br>
		<br>
		It’s composed of ambroxyde, a synthetic animal musk, making ANOTHER 13 an addictive dirty potion blended with other carefully selected ingredients such as jasmine and moss – which give it spike and shine. As the entire planet knows, Colette closed its doors December 2017, but luckily we were able to welcome ANOTHER 13 to our Classic Collection in our labs worldwide.

		As always, don’t expect just pure agarwood in this perfume. It’s even more. It’s a lot of agarwood, cedar Atlas, incense, patchouli, black pepper, saffron, and gaïac, just to mention the most prominent ingredients (there are 20 more...).
		<br>
		<br>
		Oud 27 is an amber fragrance in the purest form, overwhelming and disturbing in its signature and power. Imagine One Thousand and One Nights, distilled into 27 intense ones.

		This natural jasmine is the floral perfume par excellence, and was created as a modern alternative to the old-fashioned traditional floral signatures. Its short formula gives it such a distinctive character that once you wear it, you’ll never forget it.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		A unique floral impact whose sensuality and lure is amplified by a majestically harmonious chord of musk, sandalwood, and vanilla. We refuse all responsibility for any havoc this perfume might create in your circle of friends…

		Imagine sitting in solitude on the rugged, wide plains of the American West, firelight on your face, indigo-blue night skies above. There is nothing around save for the soft, desert wind. You. Are. Free. 
		<br>
		<br>
		From this defining vision was born SANTAL 33: a perfume that touches the vast and wild universality of this dream... that intoxicates... It combines a mix of cardamom and notes of iris and violet, which crackle in the formula. Added to this smoking wood alloy (Australian sandalwood, cedarwood) are some spicy, leathery, musky notes, giving this perfume its signature and addictive comforting scent.
		<br>
		<br>
		Here is, in a few words, what SANTAL 33 is... An open fire…The soft drift of smoke…Where sensuality rises after the light has gone.
